Daily Code Practice 🚀

This repository is my 30-day coding challenge where I write and push code every single day to GitHub.

The goal is to:

Build consistency in coding 👨‍💻

Improve problem-solving skills 🧩

Track my progress with daily commits 📈

Develop mini projects and grow step by step 🌱

📅 Plan

Week 1: Warm-up (basic problems & GitHub practice)

Week 2: Small challenges (logic & algorithms)

Week 3: Mini projects (calculator, password generator, TODO app, etc.)

Week 4: Expanding projects & improving Git workflow

✅ Progress

Day 1: Started the challenge 🎉

✨ I will keep updating this repo daily. Stay tuned for more green squares on GitHub!
