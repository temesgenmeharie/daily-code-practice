# Define a function to add a new expense entry

        with open(file_name, 'a') as f:

        # Print confirmation message when expense is successfully recorded
        print("‚úÖ Expense recorded successfully.")
    
    # Catch and handle any error that occurs while writing to the file
    except Exception as e:
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Error writing to file:", e)


# Define a function to show the total expenses by category
def show_summary(file_name):
    # Create an empty dictionary to store total expenses per category
    expenses = {}
    
    try:
        # Open the file in read mode ('r') to read all recorded expenses

                category, amount = line.strip().split(',')
                # Convert amount from string to float and add it to the correct category
                expenses[category] = expenses.get(category, 0) + float(amount)
